# fit-framework with wiremock

(F)ast (I)ntegration (T)est framework is an attempt to create a CDI, JAX-RS and JPA enabled testframework for EE applications. It includes Wiremock for stubbing out HTTP integrations (particularly REST based with JSON). 

It works by adding a JUnit @Rule to your test.
